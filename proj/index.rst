Term Project Description
-------------------------

The purpose of this project is to practice many or all of the scientific
software development skills that you will learn in this course.  The best
projects will require you to use many different skills.

All projects are expected to require at least the following skills:

* version control
* software development in some language, while employing best practices for:

  * naming variables, methods and classes
  * modularity and reuse of the code

* testing
* documentation

There are two basic types of projects, from which you can choose one:

1. Contribution to an existing open source science project
===========================================================

With this option, you will identify an existing open source science project
and make a substantive contribution to its ongoing development.  In most open
source projects, such contributions usually require review by core developers
before they can be integrated into the main code base.  In order to reduce the
burden on these developers and to ensure that your grade does not depend on
them, I will review these contributions independently.  Nevertheless, the
ideal outcome will be that your contribution is included in that project.

Some suggested projects:

* `PyNE <http://pyne.io>`_
* `


2. Development of a new open source science project
======================================================

Begin a new open source project, possibly in collaboration with classmates or
others, to provide a capability that is of interest to you.  This will require
some additional up front effort to establish all the infrastructure of a new
project, for which you will receive credit:

* license
* documentation
* style guide
* unit testing framework
* build and/or installation system


Timeline:
==========

February 23: Project proposal (5%)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In 300-500 words, describe what your project will entail and the scope of your
contribution.  You should include the set of skills that you think this
project will require you to demonstrate.

March 9: Project timeline (5%)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Provide a detailed timeline for completing your project.  Break the project
down into a series of tasks and identify when you will aim to complete each
task.  Estimate how many hours of your time it will take to complete each
task.  Identify when your project will require feedback from others in order
to continue making progress.

April 8: Intermediate report (5%)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Provide a status report of each of the tasks identified in your timeline.  Be
prepared to discuss possible changes to your timeline to accommodate the
current status.

May 6: Presentation of project contributions (5%)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Brief (~8 minutes) presentations of projects to include:

* scope of project
* assessment of progress vs. timeline
* demonstration of course skills

May 13: Final status (20%)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All contributions will be complete and final assessment will occur based on
progress to this point.
